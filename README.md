# Finovax Quantitative Researcher Internship (Summer 2025)
This is the multi-project workspace of my quantitative researcher internship at [Finovax](https://www.finovax.com/), focused on financial data, quantitative research, and backend data tools. This repository includes self-contained projects exploring APIs, data pipelines, algorithmic trading logic, and more.

## 📁 Project Index

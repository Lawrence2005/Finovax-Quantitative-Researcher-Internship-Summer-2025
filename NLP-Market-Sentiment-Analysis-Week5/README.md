2. How accurately do these sentiment analyses measure/predict the assets? Are there any proofs from these web links/sources you find that provide any backtested results or any statistical proofs validating their sentiment analysis's accuracy?
3. Please find Python code, if any, that use either one or multiple sources' sentiment or sentiment-related data to generate sentiment scores/results on financial assets, like stocks, ETF, futures, etc. Please also find Python packages/modules serving similar functions, if any.\
4. Please elaborate your own insights and analysis indicating which web sources or Python code/packages/modules/results indicate the most solid sentiment analysis results on the financial market, preferably on the stock market.

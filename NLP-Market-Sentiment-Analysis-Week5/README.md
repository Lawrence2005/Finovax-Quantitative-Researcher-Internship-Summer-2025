## ðŸŽ¯ Project Background and Significance
In today's fast-moving and news-sensitive financial markets, investor sentiment plays an increasingly important role in asset price movementsâ€”especially in the short term. With the explosive growth of financial news, social media platforms (e.g., Twitter, Reddit), and automated trading, the ability to quantify public sentiment using Natural Language Processing (NLP) has become a valuable edge in both discretionary and algorithmic trading.\
This project explores the landscape of NLP-driven sentiment analysis in the financial domain, aiming to bridge qualitative market signals with quantitative strategy design. By evaluating widely used web platforms and APIs for sentiment data, testing sentiment extraction with modern NLP models like FinBERT, and comparing how sentiment trends align with asset prices, this work helps **assess how reliable and actionable sentiment signals are in real trading environments**.\
Additionally, this project also builds an end-to-end sentiment analysis pipeline with real-world use cases. It **lays the groundwork for incorporating alternative, text-based signals into trading systems and research workflows**.

## ðŸ“‹ Project Requirements
Please write a research report related to NLP-driven sentiment analysis on the financial market including answering the following questions:
1. What are some of the most commonly referred website links for sentiment analysis on the financial market? What assets do they cover? What general calculation methods do they expose to the public of getting the sentiment results/scores, if any?
2. How accurately do these sentiment analyses measure/predict the assets? Are there any proofs from these web links/sources you find that provide any backtested results or any statistical proofs validating their sentiment analysis's accuracy?
3. Please find Python code, if any, that use either one or multiple sources' sentiment or sentiment-related data to generate sentiment scores/results on financial assets, like stocks, ETF, futures, etc. Please also find Python packages/modules serving similar functions, if any.
4. Please elaborate your own insights and analysis indicating which web sources or Python code/packages/modules/results indicate the most solid sentiment analysis results on the financial market, preferably on the stock market.

## ðŸ“¦ Deliverable
A PDF report of at least 3 pages, formatted in 12-pt Times New Roman, and a .py code file, and a .ipynb notebook including all Python code along with necessary plots or visualizations.

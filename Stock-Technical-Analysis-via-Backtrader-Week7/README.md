## ðŸŽ¯ Project Background and Significance
In the world of trading, technical indicators are essential tools used by traders to predict future market movements based on past and current price data. These indicators can be categorized into various types, including volume, momentum, volatility, and trend indicators. Each type serves a unique purpose to offer a holistic view of different dimensions and helps traders make informed decisions. This project will provide hands-on experience using [Backtrader](https://www.backtrader.com/), a popular Python library, to **analyze stock data through technical indicators**.\
Please harness the power of Backtrader and Plotly to visualize and analyze the stock AAPL's price movements using a comprehensive set of technical indicators. This project is designed to **deepen our team's understanding of how these indicators work and their practical applications in trading strategies**. The primary goal is to **plot at least 40 built-in technical indicators from Backtrader against AAPL's candlestick and volume data**, providing clear visualizations and insightful analysis of each indicator.

## ðŸ“‹ Project Requirements
**1. Indicator Analysis**
- Use the Backtrader library to access and plot at least 40 built-in technical indicators against AAPL's stock data.
- Ensure your selection includes a balanced mix of volume, momentum, volatility, and trend indicators.
- Refer to the list of indicators [here](https://github.com/bukosabino/ta) for guidance.

**2. Visualization**
- Utilize Plotly to create dynamic, interactive charts that display AAPL's candlestick and volume data alongside the selected technical indicators.
- Each chart should be clearly labeled and include a brief description of the indicator being visualized.

**3. Explanation and Analysis**
- In plain words, explain how each of the selected indicators is calculated and what it aims to represent.
- Discuss the main differences between trend indicators and momentum indicators, highlighting their unique roles in technical analysis.

## ðŸ“¦ Deliverable
A well-organized, clearly commented .ipynb file containing:
- all the code, visualizations, and text explanations
- an introduction at the beginning that explains the purpose and scope of the project
- a conclusion at the end that summarizes key findings and insights gained from analyzing AAPL's stock with the various technical indicators.

    "## 🔍 Market Regime Detection\n",
    "The various decisions and actions for profit-seeking in financial markets is driven largely by how those markets behave. When asset prices have steadily been in an upward trend for the past several months, for example, many would stay invested or even use leverage to capture more gains. On the other hand, when priecs rise along with higher interest rate, as in a couple years ago, perhaps it’s safer to opt for commodity-related investments.\\\n",
    "These distinct patterns of market behavior are known as market regimes, and they often shift because of changing government policy or broader macroeconomic conditions. Consequently, the effectiveness of different investments can also change, with impacts on returns, volatility, and how prices move over time. \\\n",
    "For this reason, it is vital to detect market regime shifts so that traders and investors can stay informed to make the best choice of quantitative strategy and portfolio allocation to better align with current environment and maximize returns.\\\n",
    "Below are some popular techniques and their applications."

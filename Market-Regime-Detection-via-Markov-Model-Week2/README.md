## ðŸŽ¯ Project Background and Significance
As part of our ongoing initiatives to innovate and improve quantitative trading strategies, we are exploring the ***application of Markov models for predicting market regime shifts***. Understanding market regimes and the transitions between them is crucial for optimizing trading strategies and mitigating risk.

## ðŸ“‹ Project Requirements
Please take a deep look into this [article](https://www.quantstart.com/articles/hidden-markov-models-an-introduction/) and then try to work on the following requests and questions:
1. Why is detecting market regime shift important for quantitative trading or investing?
2. How are they usually applied in quantitative trading or investing? Please elaborate specific examples and preferably summarize the code in a .py or ipynb file. The examples should not be directly from the link provided above. Please find other examples.
3. After reading and understanding HMM, draft a report elaborating how HMM works, but in simple plain language, instead of incorporating all the complicated math formula, and also regarding why it could be effective predicting market regime shift from the perspective of its nature. (The reason is that some readers/clients who would like to understand our strategy data services are not familiar with deeper levels of math/stats, so we will need to explain to them in easy words.) Please incorporate some specific examples to make it easier to read or follow.

## ðŸ“¦ Deliverable
A PDF report of at least 3 pages, formatted in 12-pt Times New Roman, and a .py or .ipynb code file containing all the Python code, with a list of reference links at the end of both.

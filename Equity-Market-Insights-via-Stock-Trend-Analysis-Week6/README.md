## ðŸŽ¯ Project Background and Significance
Understanding equity market trends is essential for investors and traders to make informed decisions. By analyzing historical data, one can discern patterns that might indicate future market movements. This project will focus on **extracting data for a select group of stocks, analyzing these data for trend patterns, and visualizing the results to provide clear, actionable insights**.\
The mission of this project is to develop a comprehensive Python-based data tool demo that leverages data from Yahoo Finance to analyze and report on equity market trends. This tool will help identify potential investment opportunities by examining historical price movements and trends in the stock market. Specifically, this analysis will aid our clients in **recognizing potential bullish or bearish markets or stocks**, helping them make better investment choices. It will also provide a **foundation for further detailed analysis, such as sector performance or individual stock volatility**.

## ðŸ“‹ Project Requirements
**1. Data Acquisition**
- Use the Yahoo Finance API to fetch historical stock prices and trading volumes for the following list of stocks from various sectors to provide a broad market overview:
    - Apple Inc. (AAPL) - Technology
    - Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) - Technology
    - Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) - Consumer Discretionary
    - Tesla Inc. (TSLA) - Consumer Discretionary
    - NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA) - Technology
    - Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) - Healthcare
    - JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) - Financials
    - Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) - Energy
    - Procter & Gamble Co. (PG) - Consumer Staples
    - Walmart Inc. (WMT) - Consumer Staples
    - American Tower Corporation (AMT)
- Ensure data spans at least five years to analyze both short-term and long-term trends.

**2. Data Cleaning and Preparation**
- Check for missing values and anomalies in the data. Missing data points should be interpolated or filled using a suitable method, such as forward filling or using the mean of nearby points.
- Normalize the data if necessary to ensure consistency, especially when comparing stocks of different price ranges.

**3. Data Analysis**
- Calculate moving averages for different time windows (e.g., 50-day and 200-day moving averages) to identify trends.
- Use statistical measures such as the standard deviation and variance to assess market volatility.
- Implement technical indicators like the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) to support trend analysis.

**4. Visualization**
- Develop interactive charts using libraries such as Matplotlib and Plotly in Python. These should include line graphs for stock prices and moving averages, histograms for volume analysis, and scatter plots for volatility assessment.
- Create a dashboard that dynamically displays data and analytics results, allowing users to select different stocks or time frames for detailed analysis.

**5. Interpretation of Results**
- Analyze the output from the moving averages and technical indicators to identify potential buy or sell signals.
- Compare the performance of different stocks and identify any correlations between market movements and external economic indicators.

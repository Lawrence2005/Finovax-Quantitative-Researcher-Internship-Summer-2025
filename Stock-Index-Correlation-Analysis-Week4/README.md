Project Background
In the constantly evolving financial markets, understanding the intricate relationships between different stocks and major indices provides valuable insights into market dynamics and potential risks. Historically, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) and the Nasdaq 100 Index have been two of the primary benchmarks that investors and analysts utilize to gauge market performance and sentiments. Each index comprises a different set of companies with its unique industry representation and risk factors. Correlation analysis has emerged as a powerful tool in portfolio management, risk mitigation, and investment strategy formulation. By examining how the daily returns of individual stocks correlate with these benchmark indices, we can glean insights into systemic risks, company-specific volatility, and overall market sensitivity.
Project Mission:
Our project aims to employ Python to visually and quantitatively explore the correlation relationships between individual companies within the DJIA and Nasdaq 100 indices against their respective benchmark index. You can use data sources like Yahoo Finance and their Python API to retrieve their historical daily price data.
Main Goal:
Filtering and Analysis: Please develop a computational methodology to filter and identify companies that exhibit a high correlation (greater than 0.7) with their respective 2 indices, i.e. DJIA for Dow-listed companies and Nasdaq 100 for Nasdaq-listed companies, over the past three years. Do not cross-compare, meaning you can't correlate DJIA's stocks with Nasdaq Index while filtering, and vice versa. In this process, you will also need to find live-updating sources that can provide the most up-to-date information about these 2 indices' stock tickers to get their price data. This will aid in pinpointing stocks that closely follow market movements and are potentially more exposed to systemic market risks.
Upon completion, our study will offer a clearer understanding of the interrelationships between stocks and their benchmark indices. This understanding is pivotal for investors looking to align their portfolios with market movements, hedge against systemic risks, or exploit stock-specific anomalies. The deliverables will be presented in a .py file for comprehensive examination and accessibility.
